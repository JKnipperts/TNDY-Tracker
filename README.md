# TNDY-Tracker
A complete sound tracker for the Tandy 3-voice sound (TI SN76496A or compatible sound generator chip).
Should work well on real old Tandy 1000 or PCjr hardware (A memory expansion is needed here!) and is great to use with
new retro-hardware projects like Matze79's TNDY or Serdaco's TNDLPT sound devices. 

The tracker was written in old Borland Pascal 7.0, but with just a few modifications it should compile with Freepascal as well.

## Some of the features:
- Import of the Tandy/PCjr music from Sierra AGI (AGIv2 and AGIv3) games (Kings Quest etc.)
- Import of Amiga MOD pattern data
- Option to use the PC Speaker as additional voice 
- Supports typical "tracker effects" like portamento, volume slide, tone slide, arpeggio etc.
- Own, space-saving file format
- Supports various IO port settings, even parallel port, to support new hardware projects with this sound chip
- Complete and easy-to-use player code included (100% assembler)

I plan to support MIDI and VGM file formats in the future. 

This project is actively developed by me and therefore I will update the source code here regularly.
So it's worth checking back here from time to time.

Current release is version 1.2.
