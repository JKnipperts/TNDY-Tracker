# TNDY-Tracker
A music tracker for the TI SN76496A sound generator chip. 
Perfect for Matze79's TNDY and Serdaco's TNDLPT sound devices, but I try to make the tracker work on a real Tandy or PCjr if possible. 
Later versions will also support CMS/Game Blaster as an additional output option.

## Some features:
- Import of Amiga MOD files (pattern data)
- Import of Tandy/PCjr music from early Sierra AGI games (Kings Quest etc.).
- Option to use the PC Speaker as additional channel
- Supports typical "tracker effects" like portamento, volume slide etc.
- Own, space-saving file format

I plan to support MIDI and VGM file formats in the future.

This project is actively developed by me and therefore I will update the source code here regularly.
