The development of the TNDY tracker so far:

 V. 1.0 - 19/09/20
  - Inital realease

 V. 1.1a - pre-release - 07/10/20
  - Changed timer interrupt from 1Ch to 08h and optimized the code of the
    IRQ handler (No more runtimeerror!)
  - Added file loading via command line
  - Corrected a nasty bug in TNDY unit
  - Added support for newer version of Serdaco's TNDLPT.
  - Revised screen buffering to avoid flickering
  - Revised the keyboard interface
  	- No use of KB-interrupt anymore.
  	  In Edit mode it queries the keyboard buffer of the bios (to get scan code AND characters)
  	  but skips the Bios completley by direct port access while playing (to save some CPU time)
  	- Increased compatibility for pre AT Machines
  - Setting Speed to 1 is now possible (because of the new keyboard handler and better screen buffering).
  - Fixed a bug that occured when saving an empty pattern
  - Improved the menu handling a bit
  - Fixed some small bugs and glitches
     - The cursor did not disappear or had a wrong shape
       under certain circumstances.
     - The pattern editor always jumped to row 0 when leaving a menu.
       Now you can continue working where you left off.
     - Some submenus were a bit misaligned.
  - Added "delete pattern" funcitonality (shift+delete)
  - Added an option to select clock divider for AGI files. Some old player code
    I found uses 99320 Hz instead of the 111860 Hz of the Tandy for frequency
    calculation. And actually some SNDs sound a bit more coherent with that.
  - Replaced the frequency calculation routine with a lookup table, because it took too much time
    to calculate freqs on slow CPUs
  - When editing the noise channel a specific info is now displayed.
    Instead of the octave (that is not used on this channel) now the noise type is shown.
  - Improved volume slide effect (thanks to FreddyV / Vogons).
  - A lot of cleaning up and optimizing the code
  - Some minor improvements

 V. 1.1b - pre-release - 18/11/20 (Has only been released on Github)
  - Improved the TNDY file format a tiny bit (version 2)
    - better compression of the description
    - minor corrections
  - Cleaning up and optimizing the code to run faster on original XT/Tandy machines.
  - Added three new effects for testing only (note delay, early note, note cut)
  - Now you can export your song to Sierra-online's SND file format
  - Improved the loading and conversion of Sierra SND files
  - Added menu for misc. options to turn on/off some visual effects
  - Added alternative player info screen with peak meter (F7).
  - Many minor improvements and fixes
  - still some nasty bugs to fix and it runs slow and tough on original Tandy 1000 and PCjr (but stable after all!)
     - therefore still a pre-release :(
  - tested some ideas for further effects and functions in this version


 V. 1.2 - 03/05/2021
  - Optimised the pattern editor and fixed some small issues in it
  	- Added possibility to mark, copy and paste in pattern editor
  	- Optimised delete functionalities
  - Optimised menu handling
  - Replay routines got completely revised
  - Playback now takes place completely in the background (Menus can be accessed while the song continues to play)
  - Revised order editor
  - New keyboard layout
  - Optimised screen buffering, many small visual improvements and fixes
  - Optimized the order editor (+/- to quickly adjust entries, show entered pattern etc.)
  - Fixed a nasty bug in the file selector (on a disk with just one file, the file didn't show up)
  - Now the file selector works properly with DOS 2.x
  - Completely revised screen drawing and screen buffering while playing
  - Finaly the tracker runs smooth even on a 4.7 MHz 8088 CPU !!!
  - disabled exporting of AGI files for this release because it causes some problems (sorry!)
  - Fixed some keyboard issues on Tandy/PCjr
